# Questions
Contents of xecutive summary
Does the bibliography go in the 30 page limit?
Where do I mention what I used for coding? executive summary, appendices or main body?
I have some references to websites I used for information (Like why use normalization or k-fold), are these valuable?
The introduction to autoencoders and LSTM, are those meant to be in the methodology?
I want to make some referencing to the code. Like "This was done in xxx.py or yyy.py"

Do I have to date every bibliography entry?
Link in bibliography?
Check bibliography standards
